### Price in Euro

In this challenge you have given a function that takes an array of objects as parameter. Each object
contains a property `priceInCent`. Your task is to add a property `priceInEuro`, which contains the formatted
(e.g. 15,00 €) price in euro, to each of the objects.

Example:
`appendFormattedPrice([{title: 'Offer 1', priceInCent: 15000}, {title: 'Offer 2', priceInCent: 17050}])` -->
`[{title: 'Offer 1', priceInCent: 15000, priceInEuro: '150.00 €'}, {title: 'Offer 2', priceInCent: 17050, priceInEuro: '170.50 €'}]`
