# React Bugfix Challenge

### Setup the application

Find the `react-app` in this repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

### The Application

This application constists of just one page. When the application starts it fetches a user name from
a remote API. While this operating is taking place a loading screeen is displayed. After the payload
has been fetched successfully from the endpoint the following text is displayed on the screen:
"Congratulations, user: {name of user} logged in", where `{name of user}` is the user name fetched
from the endpoint.

### The Challenge

Unfortunately there are a few bugs in this application, find them and fix them, such that the flow
described in `The Application` works.

Commit your changes to the Git repository.
